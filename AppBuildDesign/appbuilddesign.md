## Application Design and Build
- Define, build and modify container images
- Choose and use the right workload resource (Deployment, DaemonSet, CronJob, etc.)
- Understand multi-container Pod design patterns (e.g. sidecar, init and others)
- Utilize persistent and ephemeral volumes

#### Define, build and modify container images


###### 1. Navigate to the directory AppBuildDesign/TestFiles/app. Inspect the Dockerfile. Build the container image from the Dockerfile with the tag ckad-app:1.0.0. Run a container with the container image. Make the application available on port 80. Execute a curl or wget command against the applicationâ€™s endpoint.

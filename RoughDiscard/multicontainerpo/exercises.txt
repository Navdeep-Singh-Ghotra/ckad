1. Create a Pod with two containers, both with image busybox and command "echo hello; sleep 3600". Connect to the second container and run 'ls'
k run multi --image=busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml -- /bin/sh -c 'echo hello;sleep 3600' >multi.yaml
cut and paste in vi mode --> learn
k logs multi multi1
k exec -it multi -c multi1 -- cmd

2. Create a pod with an nginx container exposed on port 80. Add a busybox init container which downloads a page using 'echo "Test" > /work-dir/index.html'. 
Make a volume of type emptyDir and mount it in both containers. For the nginx container, mount it on "/usr/share/nginx/html" and for the initcontainer, 
mount it on "/work-dir". When done, get the IP of the created pod and create a busybox pod and run "wget -O- IP"
